# STRATEGIC ROADMAP: OPERATION VISUAL AWARENESS

**Mission:** Finalize User Experience with Tactical Map Integration
**Author:** Lead Engineer (Jules)
**Date:** [Current Date]

## 1. Situation Analysis
The "Sacred Steps" application is operationally sound. The backend is hardened, and the core dashboard UX is fluid. The "Group Command" feature has been upgraded from raw coordinate data to a fully interactive tactical map.

**Current Status:**
-   **Backend:** Solid. WebSocket telemetry flows correctly.
-   **Frontend:** Functional with full geospatial visualization.
-   **Security:** High.

## 2. Strategic Objectives
1.  **Geospatial Superiority:** Provide users with a live, interactive map of their group members. **[ACHIEVED]**
2.  **Instant Situational Awareness:** Markers should clearly indicate status (OK vs SOS). **[ACHIEVED]**
3.  **Production Release:** Finalize this feature to mark the product as "Feature Complete v1.0". **[READY]**

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Phase IV: Operation Visual Awareness (Priority: Critical) - STATUS: COMPLETE
*   **Tactical Action 1: Map Component Implementation**
    *   *Rationale:* Raw text coordinates increase cognitive load. Maps reduce it.
    *   *Execution:* Implemented `GroupMap` using `react-leaflet`.
*   **Tactical Action 2: Visual Status Indicators**
    *   *Rationale:* SOS signals must be visually distinct on the map.
    *   *Execution:* Implemented distinct marker colors/icons for 'SOS' status.
*   **Tactical Action 3: Frontend Verification**
    *   *Execution:* Added test coverage and verified implementation.

## 4. Execution Protocol
Mission Complete. Ready for deployment.
